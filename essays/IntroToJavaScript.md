summary: "Initial Impression of ICS 314."
---

My first programming language was Java, which initially challenged me. However, it provided a solid foundation for learning other programming languages. I see programming languages as tools in a toolbox. Each language is not inherently good or bad but serves as a tool for specific jobs. While programming languages can achieve the same goal, one language may be a more effective tool.

The course ICS 314 at UH Manoa focuses on the programming language JavaScript. As a complete newbie to this programming language, I've found it to be beginner-friendly and am enjoying the journey thus far. JavaScript has advantages, including flexibility and versatility. From a software engineering perspective, this makes it a valuable addition to one's toolbox.

My first impression of athletic software engineering could have been more positive. I am new to this learning style and had some concerns and fears about succeeding. This impression reflected my need for more confidence and experience in coding under pressure. Nevertheless, I support the concept and purpose of athletic software engineering. Just like any sport, it takes practice to make progress.

The practice WODs in class are helpful. They allow one to get in the mindset and become accustomed to coding under time constraints. The more opportunities to practice, the more one can improve this skill. Although it is stressful during these growing pains, I hope that, in the end, it will make me a better programmer.
