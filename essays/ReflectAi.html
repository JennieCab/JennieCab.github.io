  <h3 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h3>
<p>My experience with integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into my software engineering education has been a journey of discovery and enhancement. Utilizing AI tools in the classroom has provided me with insights and practical aids for learning complex concepts, coding, and problem-solving. This personal exploration delves into how I used AI and how it complements traditional educational methods by offering tailored learning experiences. These tools enhance my understanding of challenging concepts, provide grammar checks, assist in organization, create plans to approach problem sets and serve as a troubleshooting resource.</p>

<h3 id="ii-personal-experience-with-ai">II. Personal Experience with AI:</h3>
<p>I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Experience WODs, e.g., E18: AI was used only for technical issues when I couldn’t find a solution through Google searches. For example, during the initial setup of Meteor and MongoDB, I received error messages and couldn’t figure out why. When I searched on Google for a solution, it didn’t seem like a common error message. Therefore, I turned to ChatGPT to translate the error message and guide me through troubleshooting the issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In-class Practice WODs: I did not need AI because the in-class practice WODs (Workouts of the Day) focused on collaboration, creating a low-stress environment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In-class WODs: I used AI when I was unsure how to start or was stuck on an issue. I would use the prompt, ‘Act like an expert in x,’ replacing ‘x’ with whichever subject we were learning. I provided background information for the WOD and copied and pasted the section of the instructions where I needed assistance. Sometimes, AI provided an adequate solution, while other times, it did not work out in my favor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Essays: A technical essay requires a creative title to draw in readers. In this regard, AI helped inspire me to create a title that captured the essence of my essay in an entertaining way. AI also reviewed my essay for grammar, clarity, coherence, and organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Final project: In this case, I did not use AI; team collaboration, walkthrough videos, and online resources were sufficient for completing the project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning a concept/tutorial: AI is useful for understanding concepts or multi-step processes. I would ask AI to explain these concepts simply, as if to a 5-year-old. Having AI break down an idea into simple terms helps me grasp the overall topic, allowing me to review it again. An example of this would be understanding the roles and functions of Digital Ocean, Studio3T, MongoDB, and Meteor in the final project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Answering a question in class or in Discord: During in-class discussions, we were encouraged to use AI to find answers to questions related to the concepts learned that week. We would then compare these answers with results from Google, Bing, or the lecture. This exercise was useful in identifying discrepancies and determining whether the answers were flawed or valid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Asking or answering a smart-question: I did not use AI because I neither asked nor answered any smart questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”: I cannot recall the exact coding example I requested from ChatGPT. However, asking for coding examples helps in understanding Underscore and other topics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Explaining code: I used AI as an interpreter for blocks of code when I needed help understanding their purpose and function. I would copy and paste the code and ask, ‘What does this mean?’ or ‘What does the following code do?’ This approach helped improve my understanding of what was happening in the code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Writing code: AI can be helpful in writing code by providing a template or guide. However, the code may need to be edited to ensure it achieves the intended goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Documenting code: I did not use AI in this case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quality assurance: I did not use AI in this case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above: Non-applicable.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
