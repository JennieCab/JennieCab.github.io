## Overview

This project was a group effort, made up of a total of five people. We were given a problem and a guideline for a solution. The goal was to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) that could be used within the UHM community.

### The problem 

UH Manoa has over 200 Registered Independent Organizations, plus many more that do not have this “official” status but are nonetheless active organizations. Unfortunately, there is no easy way for students to learn (a) what student clubs (both registered and unregistered) exist, what they do, and how to get further involved.

### The solution 

The Clubs At Manoa application will provide a centralized directory for UH Manoa student clubs. UH Manoa students can login to browse a well organized directory of all current student clubs, with brief descriptions, meeting times and locations, URLs to their websites (if any), contact information for officers, and a few select photos.

### MVP

Clubs at Manoa provides a solid foundation toward achieving the desired solution. It represents an improvement over the original process, which involved searching through a CSV file. The major components of this app offer a streamlined process for students to search for clubs based on their interests and connect with the UHM community.
